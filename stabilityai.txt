Hi,

I've learned about Stability AI via your Stable Diffusion launch announcment [1]. I'm reaching out because I'd love to introduce myself.

I've been working as a developer for 14 years, both in small (Last.fm, Gamevy) as well as large companies (IBM, Meta, Amazon/AWS) [2]. In the last few years I've been trying to focus on ML, but annoyingly most of the cutting-edge stuff is done in the US. Because of that I'm excited to see a London based company at the front of the field.

At Meta I'm currently tech leading a team of 6, working alongside a team of ML researchers at Meta Reality Labs. I'm good at sitting between teams and making sure things run smoothly, but I also enjoy days of diving in and getting work done. 

I can help Stability AI build better services, applications and platforms. At the same time, I can work on my my medium-term goal to gain a foothold in the research side of ML.

If that sounds like there might be common interest, please let me know.

Cheers,
Marek Ventur <marekventur@gmail.com>
