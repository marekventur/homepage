            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://gamevy.com/boss-the-lotto">Boss The Lotto</a>: A lottery-themed game that turns the classic 6-out-of-49 on its head. The player’s job is to find as many good balls as possible while avoiding the 6 bad ones. Meaningful player agency, lottery-style jackpots and high win rate make thisa real first-of-a-kind game.</li>
                <li><a href="http://gamevy.com/be-the-king">Be The King</a>: Las Vegas meets game show. Focused on the online casino market this game sends the player on a constant up-and-down, putting the player completely in charge of their own game. Initially created as an exclusive this game proved incredibly succesful - Project management, implementation</li>
                <li><a href="http://gamevy.com/epic-gems">Epic Gems</a>: Taking the ideas of Boss The Lotto I pushed for a game that moves away from the lottery context towards social gaming. By also shifting the focus on speed and ease-of-use on mobile devices we managed to create a game that mathematically similar but attracts a different category of players - Initial concept, maths, implementation</li>
                <li><a href="http://gamevy.com/buzzword">Buzzword</a>: Tyring to adapt concepts of a successful gameshow into a real money online game lead to a word-game-bingo mix. The extreme influence of player agency made this game very challenging to simulate, leading to complex mathematical models and experiments - Conception, maths, prototype, paytables, implementation</li>
                <li><a href="http://gamevy.com/the-link">The Link</a>: Perceived as a "noughts and crosses" slots this game went through multiple iterations and paytables until a combintation was found that was both satisfying a slots player while at the same time appealing to more casual players - Conception, maths, paytables</li>
                <li><a href="http://gamevy.com/gears of fortune">Gears of Fortune</a>: Trying to attract a new player segment we experimented with putting trivia into real money games. With Gears of Fortune we managed to combine both skill and luck in a way that allows not-so-skilled players to win regularly while at the same time making sure that operators maintain a house edge even against pub-quiz-champions - Initial concept, maths, prototype, paytables, implementation</li>
                <li><a href="https://wortopia.de">Wortopia</a>: Multi-player word game based on "Boggle". Played by roughly 1800 players every month.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Gamevy/pixi-packer">PIXI-Packer</a>: Build tool that streamlines asset resizing and packaging for HTML5 games</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Gamevy/monte-carlo">monte-carlo</a>: Library that provides basic tools to quickly create reliable mathematical simulations of real money games, especially for those with skill elements and player agency.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/marekventur/dependency-updater">dependency-updater</a>: Open-source script that detects outdated npm dependencies in github projects and opens a PR to update them</li>
